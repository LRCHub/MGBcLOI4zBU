Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(oh, oh)
Please don't fake it,
show me what you're all about
I got wasted,
learning how to let it out
I can't take it,
kiss me with the lips of doubt
Please don't fake it,
Fake it, fake
Fake
Please don't fake it,
show me what you're all about
I got wasted,
learning how to let it out
I can't take it,
kiss me with the lips of doubt
Please don't fake it,
Fake it, fake
Fake
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Please don't fake it,
Fake it, fake
